Choreo (Constraint-Honoring Omnidirectional Route Editor and Optimizer, pronounced like choreography) is a graphical tool for planning time-optimized trajectories for autonomous mobile robots in the FIRST Robotics
Competition.

Main features of Choreo:

- Each path is created by trajectory optimization instead of BÃ©zier curves, allowing for more precise movements
- Easy to use Graphical Interface allowing real time playback
- Different types of waypoints and constraints along the path
- Robot-side vendor library installation
- Holonomic mode allows robots to move freely from its rotation
