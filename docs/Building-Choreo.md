### Development System Dependencies

Requirements for **all** platforms:

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download)
- [clang](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

### Windows

Choreo can be built and run on Windows, but it requires a few extra steps because CasADi requires the MinGW toolchain.

#### Windows Environment

Buliding on Windows requires [MinGW](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/). On the release page, download the binary labeled `x86_64`, `posix`, and `msvcrt`. Extract the `mingw64` folder to `C:\mingw64`. Add an entry to the user or system `PATH` environment variable that points to `C:\mingw64\bin`.

After installing MinGW, run `rustup default stable-gnu` to switch to the GNU toolchain that uses MinGW. This can be reverted using `rustup default stable-msvc` when returning to other rust projects.

Run `npm install` to build Node.js dependencies and TrajoptLib. Once it is finished, the libraries will be copied into `src-tauri/*.dll`. You will need to redo this step if Choreo begins using a different version of TrajoptLib.

#### Windows Dev Server

Run `npm run tauri dev -- --release` to start the dev server.

The `--release` avoids issue [#84](https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Choreo/issues/84).

If you're having a permissions error with CMake, try first building using the `cargo` command directly:

```console
cd src-tauri
cargo build --release
```

Then try `npm run tauri dev -- --release` again.

#### Windows Bundle

To create an NSIS `.exe` installer bundle, run `npm run tauri build`. It will report the location of the bundle upon completion.

### macOS

The following steps can be used to build for arm64 or x86_64 architectures.

#### macOS Environment

Make sure Xcode command line tools are installed:

```console
xcode-select --install
```

Run `npm install` to build Node.js dependencies and TrajoptLib. Once it is finished, the libraries will be copied into `src-tauri/lib*.dylib`. You will need to redo this step if Choreo begins using a different version of TrajoptLib.

#### macOS Cross Compilation

An `arm64` or `x86_64` Mac can be used to build for `arm64` or `x86_64` targets. The target architecture will be the currently selected Rust target triple.

You can create a `config.toml` file in `src-tauri/.cargo` containing the following definition to change the target from the native architecture to the other:

```toml
[build]
target = "aarch64-apple-darwin" # arm64 (Apple Silicon) target
```

or,

```toml
[build]
target = "x86_64-apple-darwin" # x86_64 (Intel) target
```

You must first install the Rust targets using `rustup target install <target>`.

#### macOS Dev Server

Run `npm run tauri dev` to start the dev server.

#### macOS Bundle

To create a `.dmg` macOS bundle, run `npm run tauri build`. It will report the location of the bundle upon completion.

### Linux

The following steps can be used for Ubuntu Linux; others may require additional configuration. If you find any additional required steps for your distro, please create a PR or issue to add documentation for it.

#### Linux Environment

Tauri requires some libraries to function, follow their [instructions](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/#setting-up-linux).

Run `npm install` to build Node.js dependencies and TrajoptLib. Once it is finished, the libraries will be copied into `src-tauri/lib*.so*`. You will need to redo this step if Choreo begins using a different version of TrajoptLib.

#### Linux Dev Server

Due to issue [#89](https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Choreo/issues/89), you must manually copy all files matching `src-tauri/lib*.so*` into `src-tauri/target/debug/` to ensure they can be found for the next step.

Run `npm run tauri dev` to start the dev server.

#### Linux Bundle

To create a `.deb` Debian/Ubuntu bundle, run `npm run tauri build`. It will report the location of the bundle upon completion.
